            "She Past Away is a Turkish dark wave/post-punk duo consisting of Volkan Caner (vocals, guitars, and songwriting) and Doruk Ozturkcan (drums, synths, and production). With their haunting sound and minimalist poetry sung in Turkish, the band has established itself as one of the most influential and successful acts in the genre. Their critically acclaimed albums \"Belirdi Gece,\" \"Narin Yalnızlık,\" and \"Disko Anksiyete\" feature a one-of-kind blend of synth and guitar-driven music, while their dynamic live performances have earned them a devoted following worldwide.\n\nshepastaway.org/listen/\n\n✦ CosmoBrigade\nlinktr.ee/cosmobrigade\n\n✦ Cold Venus Revisited\nwww.youtube.com/@coldvenusrevisited\n\nAFTERPARTY w/ (RARE)\n\n✦ whydie? \nsoundcloud.com/nothing-is-rare-anymore\n\n✦ Soyre \n\nENTRY\nEarly bird 350 CZK \nFirst wave  400 CZK \nSecond wave & on the spot 450 CZK \n\nbit.ly/F2_LIVE_SHE_PAST_AWAY\n\nFuchs2 je podporován hlavním městem Praha."

            "Originally formed in 1977 by Simon Bonney, then disbanded in 1979, a new version was formed in 1985 including members of the recently deceased Birthday Party. With only one record since then, Simon has put together a new Solution with a brand new record out on Mute on vinyl, CD and download on October 20th 2023. The album was recorded in Berlin. Core members Simon Bonney and Bronwyn Adams were joined by Frederic Lyenn (Piano, Bass, Synth), Donald Baldie (Guitar), Georgio Valentino (Synth, Guitar), Chris Hughes (Drums, Percussion) and Joshua Murphy (Piano, Guitar), and for the first time they worked with a producer, Martin J. Fiedler, who also added Synth and Mellotron to the album. Expect cinematic post punk, gothic country and rough blues rockers. Expect melancholy, joy and sadness. \n\nSupporting we have Joshua Murphy (Crime & the City Solution) who's debut EP Lowlands crafts an almost Nick Cave sound, both somber and atmospheric in his storytelling. Beautiful music indeed.\n\nTICKETS\nbit.ly/F2_LIVE_CRIME_THE_CITY_SOLUTION\non the spot - 500 CZK\n\nFuchs 2 podporován hlavním městem Praha."

The duo of Larissa Iceglass and William Maybelline appear as true romantics of the modern age, admiring William Wordsworth, fascinated by the beauty of art nouveau aesthetics, exploring British seashores and forests at night as well as inspired by the urbanism of Berlin.\n\nlebanonhanover.bandcamp.com\n\n𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗳𝗮𝗻\nDeath-inspired love story by the Athens-based duo Selofan. From the beginning, they have created their own musical environment offering us a glimpse into ii to become overwhelmed by the emotional intensity of thier sound and words. Selofan avoid the comfort of settling into one sound and style – they keep experimenting. Dreamy saxophone melodies find their way through strong drum machine beats, a new wave riff, and powerful haunted female vocals, presenting themselves in such a theatrical wave, that each love performance is emotionally striking. \n\nselofan.bandcamp.com/\n\nTICKETS\n1. wave - 390 czk SOLD OUT\n2. wave - 450 czk SOLD OUT\non the spot - 550 czk\nbit.ly/FUCHS2_LIVE_LEBANON_HANOVER_SELOFAN\n\nFuchs2 je podporován hlavním městem Praha."
